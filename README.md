# NimSequence
NimSequence is an script to determine the Nim-sequence of a game of ALLBUT. I advise to read the wiki page on [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) and the [Sprague-Grundy Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy_theorem).

This script came in handy when I was completing some homework for my Mathematics course on Combinatorial Gametheory.

## Usage
1. Download the main.py script and add relevant values in lines 20 and 21.
2. Run the program.
3. Be happy.

## Work in Progress
- Make the list of values to an array, to be able to use more than 2 values for ALLBUT.
- Make the program also work for games of SUBSTRACTION.
- Much more, let me know.
